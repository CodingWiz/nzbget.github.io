Web-apps should use `Single Letters` as shortcuts to avoid conflicts with browser shortcuts. NZBGet also uses `Shift+Letter` and `Arrows`.

If you gonna use keyboard you should activate option **SetFocus** in **Settings -> Web-interface**. With this option active when opening modal dialogs the focus will be automatically set to the first edit control. This options isn't active by default because on devices without physical keyboard it brings up on screen keyboard taking half of screen estate.

Hover mouse on a button to see its keyboard shortcut in a tooltip.
