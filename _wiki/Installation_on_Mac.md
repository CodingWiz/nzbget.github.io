## Installation ##
NZBGet is nicely packed as Mac OS X application. The installation is simple:
- download NZBGet from [[Download Page|http://nzbget.net/download]];
- unpack the downloaded app if it wasn't unpacked automatically by your browser;
- start NZBGet.app.

## Configuration ##
In the web-interface go to settings page and setup at least one news server in section *NEWS-SERVERS*, save settings, reload (soft-restart) NZBGet and then you can start your downloads.

## Post-processing scripts ##
In the menu (via menu bar icon) choose *Show in Finder -> Post-Processing Scripts*. Finder shows you the directory where NZBGet looks for post-processing scripts. Put new scripts into this directory. Refresh web-browser, the new scripts should now be shown in web-interface, available for configuration and use.
